# Rock--paper--scissor-game-with-SwiftUI
A rock, paper, scissor game with extra challenge. 
Given a challenge to lost or to win the game, the user need to choose the correct option to follow the direction of the game. 
For example, the game says beat a rock. The user will be given buttons for rock, paper, and scissor. The user will need to choose the correct option to win the game.
In this case, the correct option is paper. In different case, the game may say lose to a paper, then the user will need to choose rock to win the game.


Please note: the idea of the game is taken from https://www.hackingwithswift.com/. The code is my own with the background design from "Guess the flag with SwiftUI" repository.
